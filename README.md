# [myPrograms](https://github.com/Lu1zH3nr1qu3DA/meusProgramas/tree/main)
These are some projects I did and decided to make them public. So far, these are just personal projects or IT course projects, they're simple and basic projects that you can learn from.

  ## [cs](https://github.com/Lu1zH3nr1qu3DA/meusProgramas/tree/main/c%23)
  This folder contains some C# projects. Some of them use .NET version 4.7.2, so use that version to compile them. Those projects with the ending `8` in their name use .NET version 8.0.302, so be aware of the .NET SDK version. The available executables (`.exe`) are located in `.../"ProjectName"/bin/debug/net8.0/"ProjectName".exe`.
  
  ## [cpp](https://github.com/Lu1zH3nr1qu3DA/meusProgramas/tree/main/c%2B%2B)
  Projects in C++.

  ## [js](https://github.com/Lu1zH3nr1qu3DA/meusProgramas/tree/main/js)
  Some JavaScript, Node & Discord.js projects.
  
  ## [portugol](https://github.com/Lu1zH3nr1qu3DA/meusProgramas/tree/main/portugol)
  Projects that use the high-level algorithmic language Portugol.
